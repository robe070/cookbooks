AMNT01    HELP010      Flat Screen Maintenance    0000001                                                                                 This template can be used to create a flat screen maintenance program. You can  use the resulting program as is, or modify the resulting program yourself so    that it exactly matches your requirements. When you elect to use this template  you will be asked some or all of the following things .....                                                                                                    1. To nominate the primary file (either physical or logical) that is to be used    in this RDML program. You can enter the full file name, a partial file          name (to get a partial list of available files), or leave the name blank        (to get a full list of available files). When a list of files is displayed      the required one may be chosen from the list.                                                                                                                2. Next, you must choose and order the fields that are to appear on the            display panel.                                                                                                                                               3. Then you will be asked to specify if the change function key is to be           enabled. This will allow this RDML program to be used to modify records         in the primary file.                                                         
AMNT01    HELP020      Flat Screen Maintenance    0000002                                                                                                                                                                4. Next, you will be asked to select those fields that are not to be modified      by this RDML program. You will only be given this selection if you specified    that the change key was to be enabled.                                                                                                                       5. You will then be asked if the add function key is to be enabled. This will      allow the RDML program to be used to add new records to the primary file.                                                                                    6. After this, you will then be asked if the delete function key is to be          enabled. This will allow this RDML program to be used to delete records         from the primary file.                                                                                                                                       7. Next, you will be asked to choose and order fields from any secondary           files that are to appear on the display panel. These fields will not be         able to be modified in this RDML program.                                    
AMNT01    HELP030      Flat screen maintenance    0000003                                                                                                                                                                8. Next, you will be asked whether fields on the display panel are to be           designed across the screen or down the screen. If you have 17 (or less)         fields it is recommended that you use down the screen. If you have more         than 17, it is recommended that you use across the screen.                                                                                                      If you specified that this RDML program is to enable the add function key       then you will also be asked the following last two questions :                                                                                               9. To specify a word that describes what type of "entity" this maintenance         program works with. Some examples would be "order", "customer", "employee".     Note that only one word is used, all lowercase characters are used and that     the singular form of the word is used. Additionally, no word is more than 20    characters long. You should follow these guidelines as well to get the best     results.                                                                                                                                                     10. You will be asked to choose and order fields from the primary file that are     to appear on the add function panel. These fields will all be input capable.    Key fields of the file must be chosen.

Initially you will be asked 3 questions ....                                                                                            1. To specify a description of what the CASE construct does. This is used to       generate a comment into your RDML program. If you do not specify a value        no comment will be generated. Be brief and concise (eg: "Handle each            individual customer type separately").                                                                                                                       2. To nominate the actual field that is to be tested by the CASE construct.        Precede the field name with a "#" sign like you do in all RDML programs.        (eg: #CUSTYP is the name of the customner type field). You must nominate        a valid field name.                                                                                                                                          3. To specify how many separate conditions are to be tested by the CASE            construct. The answer must be a number in the range 1 - 20. In the example      being used here, you might what to individually test the "Customer type"        for values A, S, V and P, so you would reply 4 to this question.

This question asks you to specify a    value that is to be compared with the field previously nominated.                                                                                               In the example being used, 4 separate conditions were to be tested, so the      same question would be asked 4 times.                                                                                                                                        On the first  occurence you would answer A                                       "  "  second     "      "    "     "    S                                       "  "  third      "      "    "     "    V                                       "  "  fourth     "      "    "     "    P                                                                                                         About field types : In the example given it is assumed that field #CUSTYP is    alphanumeric. Note that all the comparison values are also alphanumeric, so     the generated RDML code should work just fine. However, if field #CUSTYP was    still alphanumeric, but the comparison values were 1,2,3 and 4, you should      surround the value with 2 single quotes to ensure that the RDML compiler        understands that it is using an alphanumeric '2', rather than the number 2.     Example replies in this case would be ''1'', ''2'', ''3'', and ''4''.

The generated RDML code can be modified to         exactly match your requirements. If you elect to use this template you will     be asked the following things .....                                                                                                                             1. To specify a program variable prefix so that variable names used in the         generated RDML code are unique within your programs. Examples would include     "COMP", "CUST", "EMP". Note that only one word names are used, and the name     LIST is not allowed. Additionally no name is more than 4 characters long.       Only use letters from the alphabet in variable prefix names.                                                                                                 2. To nominate the file that contains the data you wish to build the list from.    You can enter the full file name, a partial file name (to get a partial         list of available files), or leave the name blank (to get a full list           of available files). When a list of files is displayed the one required         may be chosen from the list.

Next, you must choose and order the fields that are to appear in the browse     list. You can choose as many or as few as you require, but remember that        only so many fields will fit across one screen line. If you choose more         then will fit on one screen line they will "wrap" onto the next line. This      can ruin the appearance of your panel. Do not place extraneous details in       the browse list.                                                                                                                                             4. Finally you will be asked whether or not you want to include a "selector"       field into the browse list. Only reply Y (yes) or N (no) to this question.                                                                                      If you reply Y, a selector field will be included into the browse list.         Use this option is you wish to process multiple entries from the list           by using a SELECTLIST GET_ENTRYS(*SELECT) / ENDSELECT loop.                                                                                                     If you reply N, no selector field will be included. In this case it is          assumed that you want to select from the list by cursor, so the required        logic is included to return #<<PREFIX>>ENTRY to the calling routine. This       variable will never be returned as zero. See next HELP panel for details.

Only use subroutine <<PREFIX>>BROWSE from other points in your program. The     second routine is used internally by the <<PREFIX>>BROWSE routine.

It does not ask any questions  .... it just generates a basic RDML program      according to your installation's standards for program layout.                                                                                                  Once your basic program layout has been constructed ..... you can then use      other Application Templates to build up the various other parts of your         program.

It will generate a batch program layout including a subroutine called PRTERROR  from the Tips, Techniques and Guidelines Manual. This can either be deleted     from your program, or used to print error details onto any report(s) that       your batch program produces.

Before you attempt to compile any function that is created from this template   you should have read the section in the LANSA Built-In Functions Guide that     explains about creating Built-In Functions that are coded in RDML.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This template will ask you the following questions:                                                                                                               Will the BIF terminate between uses (seton LR)? (Y/N)                           Do the name or description need to be overridden? (Y/N)                         If you need to override either                                                        Specify the name of the BIF (18 characters)                                     Specify the description for the BIF (40 characters)                                                                                                      WARNING. Choose the BIF name carefully with respect to the type of Built-In              Function that is being created. This name is very important.

When invoked it will ask you 3 questions ...                                                                                                           1. To specify a brief description of what the subroutine does. This is used        to generate a program comment. Be brief and concise. You must supply a          description.                                                                                                                                                 2. To specify the name of the subroutine ... you must specify a name and it        must conform to the normal naming conventions (ie: first character alpha,       following characters alpha or numeric, no imbedded blanks). Additionally        the name must not be more than 10 characters long.                                                                                                           3. To indicate whether or not the subroutine has paramaters ... you must           answer this question. Your answer governs the basic layout generated for        subroutine, which presumably follows your installation standards.
FLDTEST   HELP010   Test Field Display            0010000This template can be used to create a simple display program. You can enter     the names of up to 10 fields. The fields you enter will be displayed so that    you can review the field characteristics, defaults, edit codes, etc.                                                                                            1. You must enter at least 1 field.                                             2. Do not preceed the field name with the # symbol. If you wish to display         the field EMPNO, simply enter EMPNO. Do NOT enter #EMPNO.                    3. If you leave the field blank, then no other fields will be requested.        4. You may enter up to 10 fields.                                                                                                                               When your fields are dsiplayed:                                                 1. When the screen is first displayed, the field default values are shown.      2. The fields are not reset to their defaults so that you can enter data and       see it redisplayed on the screen.                                            3. The display loops until you press cancel or exit.                            4. Fields are displayed down the panel.                                         5. Fields are displayed using their descriptions.                               6. You cannot test field validations since no file is being used.

The user will be able to enter information into the input fields.     Output fields will merely be displayed.  It is unlikely that output fields      will be selected for a ADD screen as there will be no existing information      that can be displayed.

This sequence may be changed later using the RDML editor or the screen painter.

You can use    the resulting program as is, or modify the resulting program yourself so that   it exactly matches your requirements. When you elect to use this template you   will be asked the following questions .....                                                                                                                     1. To specify a word that describes what type of "entity" the data entry           program works with. Some examples would be "order", "customer", "employee".     Note that only one word is used, all lowercase characters are used and that     the singular form of the word is used. Additionally no word is more than 18     characters long. You should follow these guidelines as well to get the best     results.                                                                                                                                                     2. To nominate the physical file that is to contain valid data entered from        the data entry panel. You can enter the full file name, a partial file          name (to get a partial list of available files), or leave the name blank        (to get a full list of available files). When a list of files is displayed      the one required may be chosen from the list.

Next, you must choose and order the fields that are to appear on the data       entry panel. These fields will be input capable on the panel and may be         input or changed by the person that uses the resulting RDML program.                                                                                         4. After this, you are optionally allowed to choose fields that you do not want    to appear on the data entry panel, but that you do want to manipulate within    the RDML program. For example, your file may contain a "time and date" field    that records when the file record was created. You want to set its value in     the program, but you do not want it to appear on the data entry panel.                                                                                       5. Finally, you will be asked whether fields on the data entry panel are to be     designed across the screen or down the screen. If you have 17 (or less)         fields it is recommended that you use down the screen. If you have more         than 17, it is recommended that you use across the screen.

In addition, details extracted from other     files can be shown on the confirmation panel. These usually involve "decodes"   of information entered on the data entry panel (eg: enter customer number and   get shown the customer name on the confirmation panel). If you elect to use     this template you will be asked ....                                                                                                                            1. To specify a word that describes what type of "entity" the data entry           program works with. Some examples would be "order", "customer", "employee".     Note that only one word is used, all lowercase characters are used and that     the singular form of the word is used. Additionally no word is more than 20     characters long. You should follow these guidelines as well to get the best     results.                                                                                                                                                     2. To nominate the physical file that is to contain valid data entered from        the data entry panel. You can enter the full file name, a partial file          name (to get a partial list of available files), or leave the name blank        (to get a full list of available files). In addition, you can choose other      related files from which "decoded" details are to be extracted for display.

Next, you must choose and order the fields that are to appear on the data       entry panel. Fields from the base file will be input capable on the data        entry panel. Fields from other files will only appear when valid data is        being confirmed and will be protected (ie: the user cannot change them).                                                                                     4. After this, you are optionally allowed to choose fields that you do not want    to appear on the data entry panel, but that you want to manipulate within       RDML program. For example, your file may contain a "time and date" field        that records when the file record was created. You may want to set its value    in the program, but you do not want it to appear on the data entry panel.                                                                                    5. Finally, you will be asked whether fields on the data entry panel are to be     designed across the screen or down the screen. If you have 17 (or less)         fields it is recommended that you use down the screen. If you have more         than 17, it is recommended that you use across the screen. Remember that        fields chosen from other "decode" files are also included on the panel.

The use of the term "flat screen" means that no list of information will appear on the screen. This implies that all files used by the enquiry are related in   1 : 1 relationships. If you elect to use this template you will be asked ....                                                                                   1. To nominate the base file upon which the enquiry will be based. You can         enter the full file name, a partial file name (to get a partial list of         available files), or leave the name blank (to get a list of all available       files). When a list of files is displayed the one required can be chosen        from the list.                                                                                                                                                  Once the base file has been nominated you will be given the option to choose    other related files from which information to appear on the enquiry panel       should be fetched. You will only be given the option to choose from files       that are related to the base file in a 1:1 relationship.

Next, you must choose and order the fields that are to appear on the enquiry    panel. None of the fields chosen will be input capable because this template    is creating an enquiry (rather than a maintenance) program.                                                                                                                                                                                  3. Finally, you will be asked whether fields on the enquiry panel are to be        designed across the screen or down the screen. If you have 17 (or less)         fields it is recommended that you use down the screen. If you have more         than 17, it is recommended that you use across the screen.

You can  use the resulting program as is, or modify the resulting program yourself so    that it exactly matches your requirements. When you elect to use this template  you will be asked some or all of the following things .....                                                                                                    1. To nominate the primary file (either physical or logical) that is to be used    in this RDML program. You can enter the full file name, a partial file          name (to get a partial list of available files), or leave the name blank        (to get a full list of available files). When a list of files is displayed      the required one may be chosen from the list.                                                                                                                2. Next, you must choose and order the fields that are to appear on the            display panel.                                                                                                                                               3. Then you will be asked to specify if the change function key is to be           enabled. This will allow this RDML program to be used to modify records         in the primary file.

Next, you will be asked to select those fields that are not to be modified      by this RDML program. You will only be given this selection if you specified    that the change key was to be enabled.                                                                                                                       5. You will then be asked if the add function key is to be enabled. This will      allow the RDML program to be used to add new records to the primary file.                                                                                    6. After this, you will then be asked if the delete function key is to be          enabled. This will allow this RDML program to be used to delete records         from the primary file.                                                                                                                                       7. Next, you will be asked to choose and order fields from any secondary           files that are to appear on the display panel. These fields will not be         able to be modified in this RDML program.

Next, you will be asked whether fields on the display panel are to be           designed across the screen or down the screen. If you have 17 (or less)         fields it is recommended that you use down the screen. If you have more         than 17, it is recommended that you use across the screen.                                                                                                      If you specified that this RDML program is to enable the add function key       then you will also be asked the following last two questions :                                                                                               9. To specify a word that describes what type of "entity" this maintenance         program works with. Some examples would be "order", "customer", "employee".     Note that only one word is used, all lowercase characters are used and that     the singular form of the word is used. Additionally, no word is more than 20    characters long. You should follow these guidelines as well to get the best     results.                                                                                                                                                     10. You will be asked to choose and order fields from the primary file that are     to appear on the add function panel. These fields will all be input capable.    Key fields of the file must be chosen.

Typically this template would be used to         maintain code files or tables or files with less than 100 records. The          browselist of records will be displayed immediately, no search value is         requested. The browselist can contain information from other files. The user    then has the option to add a record or select a record from the browselist to   display, change or delete. These functions will be performed via pop-up         windows. The browselist will be displayed a page at a time. The add, change and delete functions are conditioned by CHECK_AUTHORITY so their related command    keys will not appear if the user is not authorised to maintain the file. The    questions that will be presented to the user of this template are as follows:                                                                                   1. To specify a word that describes the object to be worked with. The word         supplied will be displayed in the panel title of the pop up windows and         substituted into messages. Use both upper and lower case characters,            restrict the word to no more than 15 characters and use only the singular       version of the object (eg. Employee, Customer).

The file can either be a        physical or logical file. The name of the file can be specified in full,        partially (to cause a partial list of files to be displayed) or left blank      (to cause a full list of files to be displayed). When the list is displayed     the user will be able to select the file they require from the list.                                                                                            After choosing the base file, choose any related files from which additional    data will be displayed (ie. details that are to be displayed on the             browselist or in the update window).                                                                                                                         3. Next, you must choose the fields that are to be displayed in the browselist.    Remember that a good looking window (ie: one without line wrap around) has      a finite width. So only select fields that the user really needs to see in      the list. Do not fill the list up with extraneous information.

Next, you must choose the fields that are to be displayed for add. Only the     fields from the base file will be displayed. These are the fields to be         displayed in the pop-up window for add.                                                                                                                      5. Next you should select the fields to be updated. Two columns will be            presented, from the first column choose the fields that you actually want to    update. From the second column chose any extra fields that you want to be       displayed in the same panel. The fields that you choose from the second         column will be displayed protected. If you do not choose the key fields they    will be added to the change group with the display attribute *OUT.                                                                                              The panel that is presented to the user for delete will contain the same        fields as the update panel but all fields will be protected.

A header / detail style Maintenance panel typically has a Header area with      details from the file upon which the template is based, and details from other  files that are in 1:1 relationships with the base file. This template requires  that an access path be built in the header file definition that links the       header and detail files, and any related files.                                 Additionally it has a detail or list area containing multiple occurences of     information from a file that is associated with the base file in a 1:many type  of relationship. Additionally, details from other files associated in 1:1       relationships with the main file in the list area may be displayed.

To nominate the file upon which this enquiry is to be based. The file named     may be a physical file or a logical file. You may specify the file name in      full, in part (to select from a partial list of available files), or leave      the name blank (to select from a list of all available files). Once the base    file has been chosen, other associated files may be chosen. Information from    these other files may be presented on the header or detail area of the          enquiry screen. This decision is made automatically by the template             according to the files relationship with the base file. The template can        only know about a relationship if an access path has been defined.           2.

Copy this template so as not to lose the basic method of processing.         2. Use the Copied template to generate a Header / Detail style Maintenance         function.                                                                    3. From this generated function, code in the extra processing required that        meet your Site's requirements.                                               4. Thoroughly test the amended function for accuracy.                           5. From the amended function Retrofit it into the copied template.              6. Test the Copied template thoroughly.                                                                                                                         This Copied Template should then form the basis for any Header / Detail style   Maintenance functions that need to be generated.

This is to hopefully make the variables unique to this template and not         duplicate variables (field Definitions) you have created on your system.        Example: 1 or 2 Character prefix for an Order Entry Maintenance would be OE.                                                                                         or: 1 or 2 Character prefix for a Personnel Maintenance would be PE.                                                                                       The Variables that will be prefixed by these Characters are mainly used to      control some of the processing methods used by this template, for example       to define the Cursor Row and Column positioning etc. etc.

Thoroughly test the amended function for accuracy.                           5. From the amended function Retrofit it into the copied template.              6. Test the Copied template thoroughly.

In such      cases it is uneconomical to give the user search abilities as there are so      few records in the file. If you elect to use this template you will be          asked ...                                                                                                                                                       1. To specify a title that describes the type of information that will be          displayed in the pop up window. An example would be  "Company Codes" or         "Customer Types". Both upper and lower case should be used in the title.        Use at most 20 characters for the title and do not use any ' (single quotes)    in the title.                                                                                                                                                2. To nominate the file that contains the data you wish to display in the          pop up window. You can enter the full file name, a partial file name            (to get a partial list of available files), or leave the name blank (to         get a full list of available files). When a list of files is displayed          the one required may be chosen from the list.

Next, you must choose the fields that are to display in the pop up window.      Remember that a good looking window (ie: one without line wrap around) has      a finite width. So only select fields that the user really needs to see in      the window. Do not fill the window up with extraneous information.                                                                                              On the same screen you will be asked to choose the field(s) that should be      passed back to the routine that invoked the pop up window (ie: via the          exchange list facility).

For instance, in a window showing customer details you would normally           exchange back the customer number (ie: the unique identifier of the customer    selected from the window). Similarly, in a window showing company details       you would exchange back the company number (ie: the unique identifier of the    company selected from the window).

FRPOP04   HELP010   Prompt valid field values     0110000                                                                                 This template can be used to create a simple pop up prompter. You can use the   resulting program as is, or modify the resulting program yourself so that it    exactly matches your requirements. Use this template to set up a prompt         facility for a field that can contain a limited number of valid values but is   not linked to a code table. This template allows you to set up the list of      valid values. If you elect to use this template you will be asked ...                                                                                             1. To specify a title that describes the type of information that will be          displayed in the pop up window. An example would be "Company Codes" or          "Customer Types". Both upper and lower case should be used in the title.        Use at most 20 characters for the title and do not use any ' (single            quotes).                                                                                                                                                     2. To nominate the field who's valid values you wish to display in the pop         up window. Enter the full field name. The field should already exist in         the data dictionary. Do not prefix the field name with a # (hash) symbol.

IE. when the field was       created in the data dictionary it was given a type of either alpha (type        A) or numeric (type S or P). You must specify A for alpha or N for              numeric.                                                                                                                                                     4. To specify the first valid value for the field. The value can be the same       length or shorter than the field itself.                                                                                                                     5. To supply a description for the value that was entered. The description         can be up to 40 characters in length and should not contain any ' (single       quotes).                                                                                                                                                   Questions 4 and 5 will be asked repeatedly until all values have been entered.  To cause the template to generate a function blank out the line that requests   you to enter a value. All values and their related descriptions are placed in   a browselist ready to be displayed in a pop up window.

Each new HEADER or DETAIL             prototyped in any one template session will be for a new report.                IE the first HEADER protoyped will be for report one, the next header           will be for report two etc...                                                                                                                                   NOTE : You can only design up to eight HEADER and eight DETAIL sections         for any one function. This template will not allow you to go beyond             this limit. It will return you to SEC001 (the first question) when you          try prototype beyond this limit.

You can use the      resulting program as is, or modify the resulting program yourself so that it    exactly matches your requirements. When you elect to use this template you will be asked the following things .....                                                                                                                             1. To nominate the file upon which the report will be based.                       You can enter the full file name, a partial file name (to get a partial list    of available files), or leave the name blank (to get a full list of avail-      able files). When a list of files is displayed the one required may be          chosen from the list.                                                                                                                                           Once the base file has been chosen, you can select other related files that     contain additional information that is to be printed on the report. Since       the report is based (ie: driven from) the first file chosen, you will only      be allowed to select associated files that are in a 1:1 relationship with       the base file.

Next you will be asked to choose and order all the fields (from all the         previously chosen files) into 2 different categories .....                                                                                                      The first is fields that are to appear in the detail area (or body) of the      report. Most fields normally fall into this category.                                                                                                           The second is fields that are to appear in the heading area of the report.      Usually such fields are also used as "triggers" for the start of a new page.    Fields chosen for inclusion in the heading area are almost always closely       related to the order of the data in the base file (ie: its keys).                                                                                            3. Next you will be asked to specify fields that are to act as "triggers" for      the start of a new page on the report. You do not have to have picked the       field(s) previously for inclusion into the heading area of the report. For      instance, you may be printing a "Company Description" in the heading area,      but triggering a new page on change of "Company Number". When multiple          fields are chosen for the "trigger" the relationship between them is "OR".

Next you will be asked to specify a title for your report.                      Use upper and lower case characters in the title.                               Do not use any single quote (') characters in the title.                        Use at most 40 characters for the title (including imbedded blanks).                                                                                         5. Finally you will be asked whether the report should run in batch.               Reply Y or N only to this question.                                                                                                                             If you reply Y, then the generated program, when used, will request that        the user input the report run parameters and then submit a job to batch         to actually produce the required report.                                                                                                                        If you reply N, then the generated program, when used, will request that        the user input the report run parameters and then produce the report online.    If the user's request involves the reading of a large number of records from    the base file, it may "lock up" their workstation for an extended period of     time.

The DEPARTMENT and SECTION numbers held in the EMPLOYEE FILE are actually       foreign keys to a DEPARTMENT FILE and a SECTION FILE. These files contain       full details of the department and section for which the employee works.                                                                                        To produce a report of employees by department and section, a user of this      template might choose to work like this .....                                                                                                                     a.

Select the DEPARTMENT FILE and the SECTION FILE as other associated files       to be used by the report program.                                                                                                                            c.

If you reply N, then the generated program, when used, will request that        the user input the report run parameters and then produce the report online.    If the user's request involves the reading of a large number of records from    the base file, it may "lock up" their workstation for an extended period of     time.

BEGINNER options allow selection by RANGE(S) OF VALUES(S) or by LIST(S) OF      VALUE(S) . All selection values collected this way are input by formatted       input screens and they can be subjected to extensive validation checks.                                                                                         ADVANCED options allow the user to input a FREE FORMAT SQL/OPNQRYF type         expression at execution time. Additionally the selection expression used can    be NAMED and SAVED for later reuse when the report is executed again.

FILES TO BE USED                                                                Initially you will be asked to nominated a "base" file. The name can be         nominated directly or selected by normal generic searching. This file           is the one used to "drive" the report and each record selected from this        file will result in a detail line being printed. Next you can choose from       related files. Only choose a related file if you wish to print information      from the file on your report.                                                                                                                                2. FIELDS TO SHOW ON DETAIL LINES OR IN HEADER AREA                                Next you will be asked to choose and order all the fields (from all the         previously chosen files) into 2 different categories .....                      The first is fields that are to appear in the detail area (or body) of the      report. Most fields normally fall into this category.                           The second is fields that are to appear in the heading area of the report.      Usually such fields are also used as "triggers" for the start of a new page.    Fields chosen for inclusion in the heading area are almost always closely       related to the order that you are going to print information on the report.

The normal titling rules apply. From 1 to 40 characters         using upper and lowercase characters. No quote (') symbols allowed.                                                                                          4.

You have 2 choices :                                                                                                                                KEYS : means that the natural keys of the logical or physical file chosen              as the base file should be used to order data (if any exist).                                                                                            SORT : means that you wish to choose an alternate sorting sequence.                    If this option is selected then a list of all real fields from the              base file is presented. You can then choose and order your desired              sort sequence by using increasing numbers. Number the sort fields               from 1 (highest/major/most significant) sort field to 99 (lowest/               minor/least significant) sort field. The numbers you specify do not             have to be adjacent. It is the relative order that is important.

If you reply Y (yes) to this question you will then be taken through      a series of three prompts to allow you to specify .....                                                                                                         (a). Fields to be (sub)totalled (called KEEP_TOTAL in RDML terms).              (b). Fields to be averaged (called KEEP_AVG).                                   (c). Fields that are to have their minimum values tracked (called KEEP_MIN).    (d). Fields that are to have their maximum values tracked (called KEEP_MAX).    (e). Fields that are to have their different occurrences, within the order           that they are processed, counted (called KEEP_COUNT).                                                                                                      Options (a) and (b) are presented on the first prompt, (c) and (d) on the       second and (e) on the third.                                                                                                                                    When selecting fields use numbers. The numbers used are only significant in     that they order the field on the report within the totalling type selected.

The selection numbers you use are not significant other        than to indicate that the field is a trigger. The relationship between the      fields selected is "OR". So if you choose Customer Number and Part Number       from the list, then a new page will be started on the report whenever the       Customer Number OR the Part Number is different from the last one(s).                                                                                        7. SELECTION OF INFORMATION                                                        After page trigger details have been specified an option to choose how          information should be selected will appear. The options you have here are :                                                                                     NONE : No selection of information is required. All details from the base              file will be read and printed. The is very often a valid choice,                especially if the base file is a logical file/view that has its own             inbuilt select/omit criteria.

This is an easy to use and efficient method of                  selection where the base file has appropriate keys. For example,                a base file keyed by Company Number and Division Number used                    with this option would allow selection for all records, for a                   specific company or for a division within a company.                                                                                                  FIXED   : Means that a fixed SQL/OPNQRYF formatted expression is to be                    input next. The expression can be input, in parts if it is very                 long, on the next few screen panels presented. The expression                   is then generated into the RDML function and passed to the IBM                  supplied OPNQRYF command at execution time to select the required               records. Note that the expression is FIXED at generation/compile                time and cannot be changed.

However, when the BEGINNER option is chosen the report user will                be allowed to "create" the expression by a series of formatted                  and validated "range of values" or "list of values" input screens.                                                                                              When the ADVANCED option is chosen the report user will be asked                to key in the OPNQRYF/SQL expression directly. However, there is                an extended option that allows the user to "name and save" their                expressions. When the report is used at some later time the saved               expression can be instantly retrieved by its name and reused.

BEGINNER SELECTIONS (continued)                                                                                                                                 The following important points should be noted about using RANGE and LIST       as BEGINNER selections ....                                                                                                                                     -> Each range or list causes a formatted data entry screen to be generated.        This allows F4=Prompt to be used and allows simple validation (automatic)       and more complex validation (input via the RDML editor) to be used.                                                                                          -> Each range or list is converted into an OPNQRYF/SQL formatted expression.       The maximum length for this expression is 256 characters at the current         time. Thus allowing range / list selection on many fields, or allowing          large numbers of ranges or values to be specified will cause this area          to overflow. Be conservative in the number of fields that user will be          allowed to select on, and for each field in the number of ranges or             values that can be specified. If more options are required you may have         to take the base RDML function generated and extend / enhance it to             use more extensive selection facilities. This should not be a complex           task.

This is why it is called an ADVANCED option, because it requires the user       to understand Boolean logic expressions and the concept of data variables.                                                                                      However, many computer end users now use tools (especially on PCs) that use     this approach. It provides the ultimate flexibility to the end user because     it allows tailored and complex selection criteria to be used with no real       intervention from the Data Processing Department.                                                                                                               An additional facility is provided to allow the report end user to "name        and save" any OPNQRYF/SQL expressions that they have created. To provide        this additional facility you musy reply Y (yes) to a question asked in the      template and also agree to the following provisions.

When the end user keys in an QPNQRYF/SQL formatted selection expression they    may use the Add or Create function key to save it (with a 20 character name)    Later, when the report is to be run again the user can retrieve any saved       expression (related to the current report) by using the Prompt function key.                                                                                    This means that once a user figures out how to express the problem "Find all    employees who work in marketing and have zip codes in the range 1000 to 3000    and have a surnames that contain an S" they can permanently save it then        use it again later.                                                                                                                                             Expressions are saved, restored and manipulated via the RDML builtin            functions SAVE_LIST, DELETE_SAVED_LIST and RESTORE_SAVED list. All the          backup, recovery and integrity provisions in the RDML Technical Guide           apply to any expressions saved by the extended facility. No warranty is         expressed or implied in the provision of this extended capability.

This is a very powerful and flexible data base             selection routine. Like all powerful and flexible tools it can use              be abused. It is up to the system designer to strike the required               balance between function and speed when using the OPNQRYF facility.             Remember that the designer is in control of how an application design           is implemented, not the application tools that are being used.                                                                                                * When a report is generated that uses OPNQRYF it will contain an extra           routine called EXP_STATUS that is executed after the OPNQRYF command is         executed. This routine is provided on "as is" basis and it can tailored         to exactly suit individual site requirements. This routine prints a second      report that details the OPNQRYF selection and sort options used as well         as any error messages that result. It is designed to be used as an aid to       end users who are using the ADVANCED facilities, because it will describe       any errors that occur in their OPNQRYF/SQL formatted expression.

It is used to generate just one         function that must be called EXP$LST, into one and only one process on your     system. The generated function (called EXP$LST) may then be called by RDML      logic generated by its "parent" template FRPRT04. In summary, the key points    about this template are :                                                                                                                                          1. Normally it would be used just once.                                         2. The function that it generates must be called EXP$LST.                       3. It will then be called by logic generated by its "parent" FRPRT04.           4. The generated function is used to save and prompt OPNQRYF selection             expressions as working lists using SAVE_LIST and RESTORE_SAVED_LIST.         5. Calls to this function are only generated by FRPRT04 when the user              has nominated ADVANCED report production and also has specifically              indicated that saving and prompting of selection expressions is to              be supported.                                                                6. After using this template you should compile the resulting function.         7. You should then input some function level help text that describes the          saving and prompting of selection expressions.                               8.

However, the user might require some more detail, so in this case the user      would "drill down" to the next level of detail.                                                                                                                 The next level of detail comes with the second drill down report.

A lower level of detail could be obtained by progressing  to the third drill down report.

Identification of the files from which information is to be extracted.       2. The order that information should be processed from the files.               3. Details of the fields that are to be totalled, averaged, etc.                4. Report layout details such as titles, column headings, page formats, etc     5. Whether the report should be compiled for optimal performance.                                                                                            The replies to these questions are usually simple and self explanatory. However in a little more detail the questions work like this :                                                                                                          1. FILE IDENTIFICATION                                                                                                                                             Files are identified in the same way as most other templates. You are asked     to nominate and select a "base" file and then to choose related files from      which information should be extracted. Do not choose a related file unless      you actually wish to use information from it.

ORDERING THE INFORMATION                                                                                                                                        Once the required files have been selected you are given an option to           specify what order you want information from the base file processed            in. This is of course a very significant choice, because the order that         you choose relates directly to the order, levels and number of drill            down reports that are produced.                                                                                                                                 You can use options KEYS to indicate that you wish to use the natural           keys of the base physical or logical file. This is a good choice because        the access path already exists, so no sorting / access path building should     be required to process the information in this order.                                                                                                           You can also specify option SORT, and then by numbering the required fields     from 1 (highest/most significant) to 99 (lowest/least significant) indicate     the order that the information should be processed in.                                                                                                          Choose at most 8 (eight) different fields when using SORT.

This is called KEEP_COUNT.

Remember that     one drill down report is produced for each sort level.                                                                                                          Firstly you will be asked to specify a title for the report. This is fairly     standard. The usual requirements with regard to width (40 characters total),    upper and lower case characters (makes the report look good) and the non-use    of quote (') symbols apply (they confuse the RDML syntax checker and simply     mean that you will have to edit the RDML function later to remove them).                                                                                        Next you will be asked about column headings.

In this area, the final question you will be asked relates to the type of       page format you would like for drill down reports (other than the first one).

There a relatively few sorting levels.                                                                                                                     (b). Each level produces a fairly high degree of summarisation. For                  instance, if a level 2 compound sort key changes 500 times, then                an associated level 3 drill down report would produce 500 pages                 of output, because it starts a new page everytime its next higher               level sort key changes.

Since this type of drill down or summary style report is very likely to         be processing large volumes of information from the base file, and because      it has an option to use OPNQRYF (Open Query File - an IBM supplied data         base file access method), it is one of the very few templates that have an      option to use a LANSA facility called *DBOPTIMISE (or *DBOPTIMIZE).                                                                                             If you reply Y (yes) to this question you will ....                                                                                                               (a). Make the compile of the resulting RDML function take considerably               longer.                                                                                                                                                    (b). Considerably reduce the time that the function takes to produce                 the drill down reports.

FRUTIL02  HELP010   File Transfer Utility-Generic 0010000 This application template generates code to copy a file from an AS/400 file, a  LANSA/PCX file, or a PC Flat file, to an AS400 file, a LANSA/PCX file, or a PC  Flat file. You will be asked to input 3 pieces of information .....                                                                                               1. Select the file that is to be transferred. This file MUST have a unique         Key.                                                                         2. Specify the number of appendage lists required. The number required is          determined making sure that each appendage list keeps in the limit of           having a total length of no more than 255 and that the number of fields         in each appendage list is no more than 99.( The limits are not 256 bytes        and 100 fields for the appendage lists because a 1 byte field will              automatically be added to the appendage lists to specify the "appendage         option" when using the TRANSFORM_LIST Built-In function.                     3. Select the fields to be added to the Primary list and each appendage list.      You must be careful to ensure that you add a field to only one list.                                                                                       The generated code will if required prompt for the connection parameters to an  AS/400. Files are transfered using the TRANSFORM_LIST and TRANSFORM_FILE        Built-In functions. Hence, this template generates code that can only be run    from a LANSA/X session.

The type of Server to be used for the connection. This can be set to a          specific type of Server(AS/400 or Other), or the generated function can         display a window requesting the user to select the Server type.              2. If the function should allow the user executing the application specify         the files to be connected to or to automatically connect to all files on        the server.                                                                  3. If the function should allow the user to select the process to execute          from a list of all processes in the partition or to force a specific            process to be executed after connecting to the server.                       4. The name of the process to execute if the user is not to be shown a list        of processes from which to select one for execution.                                                                                                       This template makes it possible to write a function that can be started in      DEBUG mode on the LANSA/PCX platform and access data from the Server. This is   achieved by starting debug before the connection to the Server is established.

You can use the resulting program as is, or modify the resulting program        yourself so that it exactly matches your requirements. When you elect to use    this template you will be asked the following questions .....                                                                                                   1. To specify a word that describes what type of "entity" the data entry           program works with. Some examples would be "order", "customer", "employee".     Note that only one word is used, all lowercase characters are used and that     the singular form of the word is used. Additionally no word is more than 18     characters long. You should follow these guidelines as well to get the best     results.                                                                                                                                                     2. To nominate the physical file that is to contain valid data entered from        the data entry panel. You can enter the full file name, a partial file          name (to get a partial list of available files), or leave the name blank        (to get a full list of available files). When a list of files is displayed      the one required may be chosen from the list.

Next, you must choose and order the fields that are to appear on the data       entry panel. These fields will be input capable on the panel and may be         input or changed by the person that uses the resulting RDML program.                                                                                         4. Finally, you are optionally allowed to choose fields that you do not want       to appear on the data entry panel, but that you do want to manipulate within    the RDML program. For example, your file may contain a "time and date" field    that records when the file record was created. You want to set its value in     the program, but you do not want it to appear on the data entry panel.

Next you will be asked to select the fields from the file to be displayed       in the browse list. A selection image will appear in the first column of        the browse list followed by the selected fields in the sequence that you        have selected.                                                                                                                                               4. The following question asks how many entries to be displayed in each page       of the browse list. The browse list will be scrolled backward and forward       this number of entries.                                                                                                                                      5. Next you will be asked to select the fields from the file to be displayed       in the detail display. All fields are pre-selected and can be sequenced in      the required order.                                                                                                                                          6. The final question asks for a unique 2 character prefix to be used for all      working fields in the generated function.

Before attempting to use this template please read the following       notes / points very carefully ....                                                                                                                                                                                                              a. This template is provided as an example of how a template can be set up         to produce applications that conform to a fairly specific standard. In          this case the standard used is that recommended in the IBM newsletter           "Defining AS/400 Compatible Displays" (CG21-8163) for list type panels.                                                                                      b. This template will produce RDML programs that will compile and run (if          used correctly), but it also has provision for the user to specify that         additional user defined logic is required in the program. In such cases         the structure of the user logic is generated, but not the detail. The           idea is that user generates the RDML program from the template, and             then modifies and extends it to exactly match their requirements.

The processing philosopy  behind this type of application goes something like this .....                                                                                                  a. The user displays a "list" of the "objects" that they wish to "work with".      The objects in the list can be just about anything. For example, lists of       "Customers", "Orders", "Accounts", "Employees" or "Flights" could be used.      This concept fits in well with the type of manual processing that users         perform and the "object" involved usually matches with the user's mental        concept or perception of what the application system "works with".                                                                                           b. Beside each object in the list the user can enter an option number. The         number indicates that a certain type of processing should be performed          on the object. Some of these "types of processing" are very common, such        as Create, Review, Change and Delete. Some others are specific to the type      of object involved. For instance, when processing "Orders" there may be         additional options to "Print" (the order), "Send" (the order to the             customer), "Telex" (changes in the order to the customer), etc, etc.

To specify a "word" that describes the type of object that this application     works with. Use upper and lowercase characters, do not use any quote (')        characters and restrict the word to at most 15 characters. Use only singular    form. The word you specify is used to create text and messages within the       program. Some examples are "Customer", "Employee", "Order", "Account".                                                                                       2. To choose the physical or logical file upon which the application will be       based. Information from this file will be used to build the "list" of           "objects" that the user will see. It is preferable to use a view that           allows the user to produce a variety of lists. For example, a view of an        EMPLOYEE file by department, section and employee name is more useful than      a view by employee number. This would allow the user to build a list of all     employees in a department, or within a section within a department, or with     a certain partially specified name.                                             After choosing the base file, choose any additional files from which details    to be shown on any detailed enquiry display are to come (ie: details that       are to be shown when the user enters option 8 against an object).

Only files that are in a 1:1 relationship with the base file       can be chosen. This restriction only exists in this template and in no way      precludes you from modifying the program to show details from other files       that are in 1:many relationships from the base file. This template could        actually be modified to allow this to occur.                                                                                                                 3. Next you will be asked if you want an ADD/CREATE routine automatically          created. Reply Y or N only to this question. Normally option 1 is               associated with any add/create logic. This template uses 1.                                                                                                  4. Next you will be asked if you want a DETAILED DISPLAY routine automatically     created. Reply Y or N only to this question. Normally option 5 or 8 is          associated with any detailed display logic. This template uses 8.                                                                                            5. Next you will be asked if you want an EDIT/CHANGE routine automatically         created. Reply Y or N only to this question. Normally option 2 is               associated with any edit/change logic. This template uses 2.

Next you will be asked if a DELETE routine should be automatically created.     Normally option 4 is associated with any delete logic. This template uses 4.                                                                                 7. Next you will be asked if you want the any USER DEFINED options included        into the program. This question is asked in the form of "how many ?".           Reply with a number in the range 0 to 9. If you reply with a number other       than zero, you will be asked the following questions for each user option :                                                                                       - The option number to be used. This is the number that the user                  must enter beside an object in the list to invoke the particular                user defined logic. Do not use 1,2,4,5 or 8. These are the numbers              used by the standard automatically created options.                                                                                                           - The description to be shown against the option on the instruction               line of the panel. Keep it as short and simple as possible. Use                 upper and lower case characters and do not use quotes ('). Some                 examples include : "Send", "Print", "Submit", "Transmit", etc.                                                                                                - The name of the subroutine in the RDML program to handle the option.

Next you will be asked to choose and order fields that are to appear on the     "work with" browse list panel. Do not choose too many fields or the browse      list lines will wrap onto second or third lines.                                                                                                             9. If you specified that an automatic ADD/CREATE routine was required, you will    then be asked to choose and order the fields that are to appear on the add      panel. Then you will be asked to choose and order fields that you want to       work with in the add routine, but do not want to appear on the panel (eg:       time and date that the record was created). Finally you will be asked           whether fields on the panel should be designed DOWN or ACROSS the screen.                                                                                   10. If you requested an automatic DETAILED DISPLAY, CHANGE/EDIT or DELETE           routine, you will be asked to choose and order fields that are to appear        on the panel used by these routines. Fields from other associated files         will be visible in this list and should be chosen if they are required.         After choosing the fields, you will be asked to specify whether fields on       this panel should be designed DOWN or ACROSS the screen.

The processing philosopy  behind this type of application goes something like this .....                                                                                                  a. The user displays a "list" of the "objects" that they wish to "work with".      The objects in the list can be just about anything. For example, lists of       "Customers", "Orders", "Accounts", "Employees" or "Flights" could be used.      This concept fits in well with the type of manual processing that users         perform and the "object" involved usually matches with the user's mental        concept or perception of what the application system "works with".                                                                                           b. Beside each object in the list the user can enter an option number. The         number indicates that a certain type of processing should be performed          on the object. Some of these "types of processing" are very common, such        as Create, Review, Change and Delete. Some others are specific to the type      of object involved. For instance, when processing "Orders" there may be         additional options to "Print" (the order), "Send" (the order to the             customer), "Telex" (changes in the order to the customer), etc, etc.

To specify a "word" that describes the type of object that this application     works with. Use upper and lowercase characters, do not use any quote (')        characters and restrict the word to at most 15 characters. Use only singular    form. The word you specify is used to create text and messages within the       program. Some examples are "Customer", "Employee", "Order", "Account".                                                                                       2. To choose the physical or logical file upon which the application will be       based. Information from this file will be used to build the "list" of           "objects" that the user will see. It is preferable to use a view that           allows the user to produce a variety of lists. For example, a view of an        EMPLOYEE file by department, section and employee name is more useful than      a view by employee number. This would allow the user to build a list of all     employees in a department, or within a section within a department, or with     a certain partially specified name.                                             After choosing the base file, choose any additional files from which details    to be shown on any detailed enquiry display are to come (ie: details that       are to be shown when the user enters option 8 against an object).
FRWRK01GUIHELP050      AS/400 Work with - Basic   0070000                                                                                 2. (continued). Only files that are in a 1:1 relationship with the base file       can be chosen. This restriction only exists in this template and in no way      precludes you from modifying the program to show details from other files       that are in 1:many relationships from the base file. This template could        actually be modified to allow this to occur.                                                                                                                 3. Next you will be asked if you want an ADD/CREATE routine automatically          created. Reply Y or N only to this question. Normally option 1 is               associated with any add/create logic. This template uses 1.                                                                                                  4. Next you will be asked if you want a DETAILED DISPLAY routine automatically     created. Reply Y or N only to this question. Normally option 5 or 8 is          associated with any detailed display logic. This template uses 8.                                                                                            5. Next you will be asked if you want an EDIT/CHANGE routine automatically         created. Reply Y or N only to this question. Normally option 2 is               associated with any edit/change logic. This template uses 2.

Next you will be asked if a DELETE routine should be automatically created.     Normally option 4 is associated with any delete logic. This template uses 4.                                                                                 7. Next you will be asked if you want the any USER DEFINED options included        into the program. This question is asked in the form of "how many ?".           Reply with a number in the range 0 to 9. If you reply with a number other       than zero, you will be asked the following questions for each user option :                                                                                       - The option number to be used. This is the number that the user                  must enter beside an object in the list to invoke the particular                user defined logic. Do not use 1,2,4,5 or 8. These are the numbers              used by the standard automatically created options.                                                                                                           - The description to be shown against the option on the instruction               line of the panel. Keep it as short and simple as possible. Use                 upper and lower case characters and do not use quotes ('). Some                 examples include : "Send", "Print", "Submit", "Transmit", etc.                                                                                                - The name of the subroutine in the RDML program to handle the option.

Next you will be asked to choose and order fields that are to appear on the     "work with" browse list panel. Do not choose too many fields or the browse      list lines will wrap onto second or third lines.                                                                                                             9. If you specified that an automatic ADD/CREATE routine was required, you will    then be asked to choose and order the fields that are to appear on the add      panel. Then you will be asked to choose and order fields that you want to       work with in the add routine, but do not want to appear on the panel (eg:       time and date that the record was created). Finally you will be asked           whether fields on the panel should be designed DOWN or ACROSS the screen.                                                                                   10. If you requested an automatic DETAILED DISPLAY, CHANGE/EDIT or DELETE           routine, you will be asked to choose and order fields that are to appear        on the panel used by these routines. Fields from other associated files         will be visible in this list and should be chosen if they are required.         After choosing the fields, you will be asked to specify whether fields on       this panel should be designed DOWN or ACROSS the screen.

Before attempting to use this template please read the following       notes / points very carefully ....                                                                                                                              a. This template is provided as an example of how a template can be set up         to produce applications that conform to a specific standard. In this case       the standard used is that recommended in the IBM newsletter "Defining           AS/400 Compatible Displays" (CG21-8163) for list type panels.                                                                                                b. This template will produce RDML programs that will compile and run (if          used correctly), but it also has provision for the user to specify that         additional user defined logic is required in the program. In such cases         the structure of the user logic is generated, but not the detail. The           idea is that user generates the RDML program from the template, and             then modifies and extends it to exactly match their requirements.                                                                                            c. This template is a foundation template. It is designed to lay a foundation      for an organised and structured User Interface and for an RDML developers       to further build upon it in an organised and structured environment.

The most important  ways that this template, FRWRK02, differs from FRWRK01 are :                                                                                                    (a). Multiple views of the same physical data set can be chosen (up to 5) to         provide better "selection" capabilities when building the list of objects       that are to be "worked with". At least 2 views should always be used.                                                                                      (b). Function key F6=Create is used to signify a create request rather than          the option 1=Create used in template FRWRK01. While template FRWRK01 is         strictly correct (by CUA standards) the F6=Create facility is the one           most commonly used in IBM supplied "work with" applications.                                                                                               (c). An option number can be specified against an object either by typing it         into the "Opt" column beside the object instance, or, by positioning the        cursor on the same line as the instance and pressing enter. The required        option can then be chosen from the resulting pop-up window. The function        then acts just as if the option number was typed in beside the instance.

Use upper and lowercase characters, do not use any quote (')        characters and restrict the word to at most 15 characters. Use only singular    form. The word you specify is used to create text and messages within the       program. Some examples are "Customer", "Employee", "Order", "Account".                                                                                       2. To choose the physical or logical file(s) upon which the application will       be based. Up to 5 files can be chosen. They must all share the same set of      underlying data. The key(s) of these files are then used to allow the user      to build up a list of the "objects" they want to work with in differing         ways. In fact, you should be using at least 2 views of the same physical        data set to use this template as it was intended to be used.                    For example, you might have a "Customer" object based on a Customer Master      file. By using views by Customer Number, Customer Name, Account Manager and     Zip Code you are allowing the user a large amount of flexibility in building    up the list of "Customers" that they wish to "Work With". For each file view    nominated you must describe access by the view (eg: "By Account Manager").

Next you will be asked if you want an ADD/CREATE routine automatically          created. Reply YES or NO only to this question. Normally F6=Create is           associated with any create logic. This is different to template FRWRK01.        Template FRWRK01 uses option 1=Create in the object list to indicate a          "create" action, which is the strictly correct by the CUA standards.            However, this template uses the F6=Create variation because it is the           common variation found in IBM supplied "work with" applications.                                                                                             4. Next you will be asked if you want a DETAILED DISPLAY routine automatically     created. Reply YES or NO only to this question. Normally option 5 or 8 is       associated with any detailed display logic. This template uses 8.                                                                                            5. Next you will be asked if you want an EDIT/CHANGE routine automatically         created. Reply YES or NO only to this question. Normally option 2 is            associated with any edit/change logic. This template uses 2.

Next you will be asked if a DELETE routine should be automatically created.     Normally option 4 is associated with any delete logic. This template uses 4.                                                                                 7. Next you will be asked if you want the any USER DEFINED options included        into the program. This question is asked in the form of "how many ?".           Reply with a number in the range 0 to 9. If you reply with a number other       than zero, you will be asked the following questions for each user option :                                                                                       - The option number to be used. This is the number that the user                  must enter beside an object in the list to invoke the particular                user defined logic. Do not use 1,2,4,5 or 8. These are the numbers              used by the standard automatically created options.                                                                                                           - The description to be shown against the option on the instruction               line of the panel. Keep it as short and simple as possible. Use                 upper and lower case characters and do not use quotes ('). Some                 examples include : "Send", "Print", "Submit", "Transmit", etc.                                                                                                - The name of the subroutine in the RDML program to handle the option.

Next you will be asked to choose and order fields that are to appear on the     "work with" browse list panel. Do not choose too many fields or the browse      list lines will wrap onto second or third lines. Be conservative.                                                                                            9. If you specified that an automatic ADD/CREATE routine was required, you will    then be asked to choose and order the fields that are to appear on the add      panel. Then you will be asked to choose and order fields that you want to       work with in the add routine, but do not want to appear on the panel (eg:       time and date that the record was created). Finally you will be asked           whether fields on the panel should be designed DOWN or ACROSS the screen.                                                                                   10. If you requested an automatic DETAILED DISPLAY, CHANGE/EDIT or DELETE           routine, you will be asked to choose and order fields that are to appear        on the panel used by these routines.                                            After choosing the fields, you will be asked to specify whether fields on       this panel should be designed DOWN or ACROSS the screen.
